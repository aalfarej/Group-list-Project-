Describing My Project

Teachers Point of view 

If I were a teacher and I was using the program that Ali Alfarej has created, it would make my life much easier when it has to come to picking specific students to pair up with each other. The program will consist of a  “input - output” type of machine. The machine would already contain the students that are in my class, and it would simply first ask me how big I want my groups to be. It can be two, three, or even four. If i pick four it would randomly created groups of four and make my life much easier. It will arrange them in a good group with diversity that have girls and guys in a group. This would make my life much easier due to the fact that I don't have to go through the stress on having to create a group and stress out on making them good and perfect. 
First Part of the Project
In the first week of working on my project I think that I can accomplish making at least creating the list of stupid and putting in a function that will randomize them in a group. Then if i have time I would start to make it more complex in putting in the program the function of breaking the groups in groups of two, three, and even four. 
Tests
The tests that could be done to my project would be to make sure if all the possible choices to create a group would work and be possible. Meaning that the teacher can insert the minimum and maximum and all numbers between of the numbers of students in a group and it will work completely fine.
