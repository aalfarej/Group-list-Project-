# Group-list-Project-
Describing My Project

Teachers Point of view 

If I were a teacher and I was using the program that Ali Alfarej has created, it would make my life much easier when it has to come to picking specific students to pair up with each other. The program will consist of a  “input - output” type of machine. The machine would already contain the students that are in my class, and it would simply first ask me how big I want my groups to be. It can be two, three, or even four. If i pick four it would randomly created groups of four and make my life much easier. It will arrange them in a good group with diversity that have girls and guys in a group. This would make my life much easier due to the fact that I don't have to go through the stress on having to create a group and stress out on making them good and perfect. 
First Part of the Project
In the first week of working on my project I think that I can accomplish making at least creating the list of stupid and putting in a function that will randomize them in a group. Then if i have time I would start to make it more complex in putting in the program the function of breaking the groups in groups of two, three, and even four. 
Tests
The tests that could be done to my project would be to make sure if all the possible choices to create a group would work and be possible. Meaning that the teacher can insert the minimum and maximum and all numbers between of the numbers of students in a group and it will work completely fine.



Reflections And revisions

The project overall went pretty well. Of course in the begining I had some troubles with getting started with my project because my project had many ways into completing it. But towards the end I got help and got the hang of it and it went really well. If i had any changed to my project it would proobably be the fact of adding even more features to my group listing. Features like I would want to add the ability of dividing groups with a larger quantitiy like instead of groups of 5 or 3, i could make it go up to gorups of 23 for example. 

Next steps

Like i stated before my next steps for this project would be to enhance and add more fetures of making it have the ability to split groups into much larger quantities. And that is what i hope to accomplish in the next round
